One of my favorite things to take away from this article is "communicate - not guess". After going in-depth about specific methods and tips for more effective communication with designers, it's easy to see how these same suggestions can be applied to more effective communication with coworkers in general. Remaining constructive and always moving the discussion forward will keep the entire project productive.
