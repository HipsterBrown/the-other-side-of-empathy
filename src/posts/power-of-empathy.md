> Empathy is feeling _with_ people.

This video was shared in several talks during [WhatTheFest Berlin](http://wwwtf.berlin) and is a fantastic intro for anyone researching empathy. The use of animation to make the subject more approachable and informative is very well done. It dives straight into the core of empathy as a means for connecting with others and pushing away judgement in an effort to understand.
