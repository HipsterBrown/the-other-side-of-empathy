    <p>JavaScript Jabber tends to get fairly technical during most shows, so this interview with John Sonmez was a pleasant contrast. While &quot;soft skills&quot; are usually given less importance in the developer world, it was wonderful to hear John and the panel discuss how relationship skills generally lead to happier programmers. This is also the third episode with Aimee Knight, who has been a superb addition to the male dominated panel.</p>
