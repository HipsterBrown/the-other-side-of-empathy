I've really been enjoying this podcast interviewing various designers about their work and insights, and this episode with Kim Bost & Cap Watkins is definitely my favorite so far. Their ideals in sharing context in the collaborative design process and applying empathy with co-workers are exactly what I'd like to see more developers embrace. That discussion begins about 30 minutes in but I encourage listening to the entire episode.
