In this conference talk, [Brenna O'Brien](https://twitter.com/brnnbrn) discusses what she loves most about JavaScript, the community. She covers why it's important to remember what it was like to start out in the community and channel that empathy into the resources we provide online, i.e. code examples without arbitrary jargon like "foo" and "bar". One of the best points to follow is removing condescending language, like "simply" and "just", while teaching others.
